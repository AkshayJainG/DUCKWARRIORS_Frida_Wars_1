This is the first challenge we built for the first [frida-wars](https://sec-r.et/).

Credits for the awesome work to [@jeanbmar](https://github.com/jeanbmar) [@bhargavhegde001](https://github.com/bhargavhegde001) [@veronicapablo](https://github.com/veronicapablo) [@AkshayJainG](https://github.com/AkshayJainG) and [@iGio90](https://github.com/iGio90)

The goal is to read from memory a String with that format: 
**{secRet-[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]}**

We ensure, as per competition rule, that the flag is built in memory when an action is perfomed by the user and no external tools is altering the execution.
